# REACT website: interactive hangman game

This website created by me and my partner Arancha, the user will immerse themselves in a world of words and strategies, where each attempt to guess the hidden word is an opportunity to have fun and improve their linguistic skills. With a friendly and intuitive interface, the hangman game becomes an interactive experience that awakens your curiosity and invites you to participate.
